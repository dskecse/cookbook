# Styleguide
> Style is what separates the good from the great. <br>

Here is a style guide that works for our team.

## Git
* Write your commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed bug" or "Fixes bug."
* Capitalize first line of commit message.
* Write short summary of changes in the first line and detailed description above after blank line.
* Indent code samples with two spaces.

Example of good explanation of changes:
```
Add hello method

You can now just use KillerApp#hello method for saying "Hello world". Example:

  def say_hello
    app = KillerApp.new
    app.hello
  end
```
